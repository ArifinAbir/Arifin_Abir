I am new here, pardon my mistake. Me and my friend Dhruba Paul and Jakir hossain together developed a SpellC Checker Application.
Which is developed in C language. 
For user interface we haved use WIN_32 anf for generating suggestion, We have used Levenshtein Lagorithm.  
And the dictionary alpha_text is collected from Github and some words are add by us. 
Before runs the code , you have to set compiler stting> Linker setting> Add "ws2_32" and gdi32. These should be in line by line.
Thank You!
